## Executive Summary  

### **_Project Overview_**   

This ***WEMPRO01*** project (**W**arehouse **E**mployee **M**anagement **PRO**ject **01**), aims to control the productivity of a logistics warehouse employee workforce, with AI, before and after the workday.  

### ***Objectives***

To do so, the following scheme is followed:  

1. ***Before the Workday***  
1.1. ***Task Planning***: Use AI algorithms to assign daily tasks based on workload, employee skills, and warehouse priorities.
1.2. Route Optimization: Implement AI systems that optimize routes within the warehouse to minimize travel time and maximize efficiency.
1.3. ***Predictive Analysis***: Use AI to predict demand spikes and adjust staff planning accordingly.
1.4. ***Personalized Training***: Use AI to identify areas for improvement in employee skills and provide personalized training before the workday begins.

2. ***During the Workday***
2.1. Real-Time Monitoring: Use sensors and cameras connected to AI systems to monitor performance and safety in real time.
2.2. Virtual Assistants: Deploy virtual assistants that can provide immediate support to employees, answering questions and resolving issues quickly.
2.3. Data Analytics: Collect and analyze data in real time to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

3. ***After the Workday***
3.1. ***Performance Evaluation***: Use AI to analyze each employee's daily performance and provide detailed feedback.
3.2. ***Automated Reports***: Generate automatic reports that summarize the day's productivity and highlight areas for improvement.
3.3. Predictive Maintenance: Use AI to predict and plan maintenance for equipment and machinery, ensuring everything is in top condition for the next workday.
3.4. ***Trend Analysis***: Use AI to analyze long-term trends in productivity and make strategic adjustments to warehouse management.

As you can see, in this project (01), we will deal with tasks **1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.4**. We will use ***Random Forest*** and ***Neural Networks techniques*** to do that.

### ***Datasource description***  

The dataset was created using an AI assistant (Copilot), although we relied on our experience.

Go to storytelling to learn about our client and us.

Every day, from Monday to Friday, there are 2 shifts. Shifts A and B work 11 hours and a quarter (day), shift N works 7 hours (night).

A and B work alternate days. N works every day. 

A and B's schedule is the same:
- From 8 am to 10 they work at the warehouse
- At 10 o'clock employees take a break to have breakfast of half an hour.
- At 10:30 they continue to work until 15:00.
- They take a break to have lunch form 15:00 to 16:00
- After that tey work until 18:00. Then, they take a break for 15 minutes
- From 18:15 to 21:00 they continue working
