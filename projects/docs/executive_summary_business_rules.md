## Executive Summary  

### **_Business rules_**  

## Insulin

***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">Insulin</span>][r000]***: Insulin is a polypeptide hormone produced and secreted by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It allows glucose to enter cells, playing a role in the control of blood glucose levels and in the metabolism of nutrients for the synthesis of cellular components such as glycogen and triglycerides.  

![Insulin][i000]  

## Insulin resistance  

***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">Insulin resistance</span>][r001]***: Insulin resistance is a health disorder in which tissues have a diminished response to absorb circulating glucose in the presence of insulin; particularly the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. As a result, the pancreas produces more insulin to help glucose enter the cells. As long as the pancreas can produce enough insulin to overcome the weak response of the cells to insulin, blood glucose levels will remain within a healthy range.

![Insulin resistance][i001] 

## Prediabetes

***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">Prediabetes</span>][r002]***: Prediabetes is a medical term referring to blood glucose levels that are above normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes mellitus (a level between normal and diabetes). Individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetes range are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in the near future, as well as cardiovascular complications.  

![Prediabetes][i002]  

However, in most people, prediabetes is asymptomatic and by reducing the consumption of foods with a medium glycemic index, restricting high glycemic index foods in the diet, increasing physical activity, and losing weight, type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented. In other people, symptoms of prediabetes may manifest as fatigue, polyphagia (abnormal increase in the need to eat), or polydipsia (abnormal increase in the need to drink). Other common symptoms are weight gain and polyuria (excessive urination).

***Incidence***

In the United States, approximately 1 in 3 adults has prediabetes.

***Individuals with higher risk of developing prediabetes***

People with a genetic background or an inadequate lifestyle are more likely to develop insulin resistance or prediabetes.

***Risk factors***

- Overweight or obesity
- $\ge$ 45 years old
- Parent or sibling with diabetes
- Ethnic group (African American, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander)
- Physical inactivity
- High blood pressure
- Abnormal cholesterol levels
- History of gestational diabetes
- History of heart disease or stroke
- Polycystic ovary syndrome
- Metabolic syndrome (a combination of high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and a large waist) are more likely to have prediabetes
- Certain medications (glucocorticoids, some antipsychotics, and some HIV medications)
- Hormonal disorders (Cushing's syndrome and acromegaly)
- Sleep problems (especially sleep apnea)

Although people cannot change risk factors such as family history, age, or ethnic group, they can change lifestyle-related risk factors such as diet, physical activity, and weight. These lifestyle changes can reduce the likelihood of developing insulin resistance or prediabetes.

Researchers do not fully understand what causes prediabetes, but they believe that excess weight and lack of physical activity are major factors.

***Overweight***

Obesity, especially excess fat in the abdomen and around the organs (visceral fat), is a major cause of insulin resistance. A waist measurement of $\ge$ 102 cm in men and $\ge$ 89 cm in women is associated with insulin resistance, even if BMI is in the normal range. This is exacerbated in asians and native americans.

Fat tissue, besides storing energy, produces hormones and other substances that can contribute to chronic inflammation, which may play a significant role in insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Excess weight can lead to insulin resistance, which in turn can play a role in developing fatty liver disease.

***Physical Inactivity***

Regular physical activity causes changes in the body that make it more capable of maintaining balanced blood glucose levels.

***Symptoms***

Insulin resistance and prediabetes ***usually do not present symptoms. Some people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpits or on the back and sides of the neck, a condition called acanthosis nigricans. Many small skin growths called skin tags often appear in these same areas***.  

Although blood glucose levels are not high enough to cause symptoms in most people, some people with prediabetes may already have ***early changes in their eyes that can lead to retinopathy***. This problem occurs more frequently in people with diabetes.

***Diagnosis***

To diagnose prediabetes, the fasting plasma glucose test and the oral glucose tolerance test are frequently used. The fasting plasma glucose test and the oral glucose tolerance test show the blood glucose level at the time of the test.

The fasting plasma glucose test is not as sensitive as the oral glucose tolerance test. In some people, it may not detect prediabetes that the oral glucose tolerance test might reveal. The oral glucose tolerance test can identify how the body handles glucose after a meal, often before fasting blood glucose levels become abnormal. It is also often used to detect gestational diabetes.

People with prediabetes have up to a 50% chance of developing diabetes in the next 5 to 10 years.

Testing for prediabetes should be done if you are overweight or obese, or if you have one or more risk factors that can contribute to the development of diabetes. Even if there are no risk factors, testing should begin at age 45.

If the results are normal but there are other risk factors that may contribute to the development of diabetes, the test should be repeated at least every 3 years.  

## Blood pressure

***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">Blood pressure</span>][r003]***:  Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels, and it is one of the principal vital signs. Blood pressure decreases as blood moves through arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins; the term blood pressure generally refers to arterial pressure, which is the pressure in the large arteries, the arteries that carry blood from the heart. It was commonly measured using a sphygmomanometer, which used the height of a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure. Blood pressure values are expressed in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), even though many modern vascular pressure devices no longer use mercury.  

![Blood pressure][i003]  

* ***Diastolic*:** Measured when the ventricles of the heart relax. A diastolic pressure of 80 millimeters of mercury is considered within the range of normal pressure levels.

* ***Systolic*:** Refers to the pressure of the blood in the artery when the heart contracts. It is the upper (and highest) number in a blood pressure measurement. A systolic pressure of 120 millimeters of mercury is considered within the range of normal pressure levels.

***The normal measurement would be expressed as "120 over 80".***

***Table of Diastolic Blood Pressure by Age and Sex (Women)***

| Age | Diastolic Pressure |
| :-: | :----------------: |
| [16, 18] | [60, 85] |
| [19, 24] | [60, 85] |
| [25, 29] | [60, 86] |

## Blood glucose concentration (mg/dl), fasting

***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">Glycemia</span>][r004]***: Blood glucose is the measure of the concentration of free glucose in the blood, serum, or plasma. It is one of the most important variables regulated by the body (homeostasis) in the internal environment.

***Fasting blood glucose:*** Determines blood sugar levels after a minimum fast of 8 hours. It is the first test performed to diagnose carbohydrate metabolism disorders, especially diabetes mellitus and hypoglycemia.

***Postprandial blood glucose:*** After eating, it is normal for blood glucose levels to rise during the first two hours.

![Glycemia][i004]  

***Measures***

* ***0 is absurd***.  
* ***(, 54] requires immediate action***.  
* ***(54, 70] is hypoglycemia***.  
* ***(70, 100] is normal***.
* ***(100, 125] is prediabetes***.
* ***[126,] is diabetes***.  

***Oral glucose tolerance test***  

* ***0 is absurd***.
* ***(, 140] is considered normal***.
* ***(140, 199] indicates prediabetes***.
* ***[200,] after two hours indicates diabetes***.  

This test is used less frequently than the others, except during pregnancy. ***You will need to fast overnight and then drink a sugary liquid*** at the lab center. ***Blood glucose levels are checked periodically over the next two hours***.

***Hypoglycemia***

If hypoglycemia is not treated, ***more serious symptoms may occur, such as drowsiness, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness***.

***Types Low blood sugar***:  

* ***Mild low blood sugar*** may make you feel hungry or want to throw up. You may also feel agitated or nervous. Your heart may beat fast. You may sweat. Or your skin may become cold and clammy.  

* ***Moderate low blood sugar*** often makes people feel irritable, nervous, scared, or confused. You may have blurry vision. You may also have trouble keeping your balance or walking.  

* ***Severe low blood sugar*** can make you faint. You may have seizures. It may even cause ***coma or death***.  

***Normal glucose levels by age***

| age | fasting | tolerance test |
| :--: | :-------: | :------------------: |
| [0, 5]  | [100-180] | 200 |
| [6, 12] | [90-180]  | 200 |
| [13, 19)| [90-130]  | 180 |
| [19, 35)| [90-130]  | 140 |
| [35, 60)| [90-100]  | 150 |
| [60, )  | [90-100]  | 160 |

***Gestational diabetes***

If you are being tested for gestational diabetes, your doctor will consider the results of each blood glucose test.

If your blood glucose level is higher than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) after the one-hour test, your doctor will recommend the three-hour test. If the blood glucose level is higher than 190 mg/dL (10.6 mmol/L) after the one-hour test, gestational diabetes will be diagnosed.

Normal glucose levels in the three-hour test:

* ***Fasting => (, 95)***.  
* ***1h after drinking the glucose solution => (, 180)***.  
* ***2h after drinking the glucose solution => (, 155)***.  
* ***3h after drinking the glucose solution => (, 140)***.  

## Triceps skinfold thickness  

***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">Triceps skinfold thickness</span>][r005]***: Measuring skinfolds helps to assess fat deposits in the human body.  

![Triceps skinfold thickness][i005]  

A skinfold indirectly ***measures the thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue***. That is, values ​​obtained from measuring skinfolds at different points on the body ***can be used to*** predict body density and ***calculate fat mass and fat-free mass***. Ideal values ​​are highly dependent on age and sex.  

Table of ideal values ​​for women:  

| age | range skinfold |
| :--: | :-----------: |
| [18, 20] | [17.7, 21.5] |
| [21, 25] | [20.3, 23.8] |
| [26, 30] | [20.9, 24.5] |

## Insulin concentration in blood

***Normal insulin levels***  

State  Children and Adolescents
| Status                           | Men and Women (Adults) | Children and Adolescents       |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Fasting** | 5-25 U/mL | Levels generally lower than in adults, with no clear consensus specific to sex and age |  

If the level > 30 U/ml fasting, insulin resistance is considered.

***Oral glucose tolerance test***  

| Time after glucose intake | Insulin level (µU/mL)  |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Fasting                               | 5-25 U/mL                  |
| 2h                                   | 5-64 µU/mL                  |

***Variation factors***  

| Factor         | Description                                                                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Age**       | Insulin sensitivity may decrease with age, resulting in higher levels in older people |
| **Sex**       | Hormonal differences may play a role, although the ranges are similar for adults of both sexes         |

Hyperinsulinemia results in a higher amount of insulin in the blood than is considered normal. Some of the clinical conditions that trigger this imbalance are the following:

* ***Type 2 diabetes***: hyperinsulinemia, in itself, ***does not imply diabetes***. However, the fact that the pancreas produces more of this hormone is usually related to the fact that the cells are not able to interact correctly with it, which does indicate type 2 diabetes.

* Insulinoma: is a tumor of the pancreas that causes too much insulin to be secreted. This, in turn, leads to a condition of hypoglycemia.

* Nesidioblastosis: is a hyperplasia of the islets of Langerhans, the pancreatic structures that are responsible for producing hormones such as insulin and glucagon.  

## BMI  

***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">BMI</span>][r006]***: The body mass index (BMI) is a mathematical ratio that associates the mass (weight) and height of an individual.  

It is calculated according to the operation  

BMI = ($\frac{weight\ in\ Kg}{(height\ in\ m)^2}$)  

​
where the mass is expressed in kilograms and the square of the height in meters squared, being the unit of measurement of the BMI in the MKS system.

![BMI][i006]  

BMI table for women by age  

| age     | BMI      | rating |
| :--:     | :-:      | :--------: |
| [19, 24] | [19, 24] | normal     |
| [25, 34] | [20, 25] | normal     |

| [55, 64] | [23, 28] | normal     |
| [65, )   | [24, 29] | normal     |

As you can see, factors such as age and sex change the limits of the intervals. However, in general, the following table is accepted:  

| BMI          | rating             |
| :-:          | :--------:             |

## Diabetes  

***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">Diabetes mellitus</span>][r007]***: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders, whose main common characteristic is the presence of persistently or chronically high concentrations of glucose in the blood, due either to a defect in insulin production, to a resistance to its action to use glucose, to an increase in glucose production or to a combination of these causes. It is also accompanied by abnormalities in the metabolism of lipids, proteins, mineral salts and electrolytes. That is, diabetes is a disease that occurs when the ***level of glucose in the blood***, also called blood sugar, is ***too high***. Blood glucose is the main source of energy and comes from the food we eat. ***Insulin***, a hormone produced by the pancreas, ***helps glucose*** from food ***reach the cells to be used as energy***.  

![Diabetes mellitus][i007]  

***Symptoms of diabetes***  

* Hunger and fatigue, because the body does not convert the food it eats into all the glucose it could produce, for the cells to obtain energy.  
  
* Urinating more frequently and being more thirsty.  

* Dry mouth and itchy skin.  

* Blurred vision.  

***If one parent had diabetes, the probability of suffering from diabetes is 40%. If both parents had diabetes, then the probability of suffering from diabetes is 70%***.

***The normal prevalence in a population of women is between 7% and 10%***.
