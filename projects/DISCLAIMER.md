All the ***data source is licensed as public domain***, but ***woman#01 is an individual and anonymous person***. In this project, ***I constructed a narrative (simulating being healthcare professional)*** that contains solutions and improvement proposals. ***This narrative is contrasted with conclusions from other works and the population's evolution over the last 40 years***.

Iâ€™d like to express my gratitude to ***Kaggle*** for publishing this database, which was originally created by the [***US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases***](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) in 1984.

As data scientists, ***our goal is to build ML models that help classify and predict the outcomes of future cases***.

***Our model would fall short if we didn't extract conclusions (health-related, in our case), considering the business rules***.
