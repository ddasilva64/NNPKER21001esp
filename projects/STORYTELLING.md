## Storytelling 

All dataset sources are licensed in the public domain. In this project, ***I constructed a narrative (simulating being healthcare professional)*** that contains solutions and improvement proposals. ***This narrative is contrasted with conclusions from other works and the population's evolution over the last 40 years***.  

As data scientists, ***our goal is to build ML models that help classify and predict the outcomes of future cases***.

***Our model would fall short if we didn't extract conclusions (health-related, in our case), considering the business rules***.

The dataset source is [***Kaagle pima-indians-diabetes dataset***](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumargh/pimaindiansdiabetescsv), used in the course **_"Decision Trees and Random Forest with Python and scikit-learn" by Platzi_**. Additionally, outliers and overfitting were discussed and conclusions and recommendations were drawn.

The present project **_PRODIA001_** is an exercise for the **_"Decision Trees and Random Forest with Python and scikit-learn" Platzi course_**.

Anyway, what can we get from data in this project? It can happen, as Forrest Gump said:  

> **_"Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you gonna get."_**

That's all folks!!!
